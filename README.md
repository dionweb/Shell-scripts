### CleanArch .sh

After upgrading ArchLinux you may now have unwanted .pkg from the system and packages that are no longer needed or that are no longer in the official repositories. I created this script to maintain my system. It cleans pkg cache, home cache and unused/orphan packages. Works only with Arch or Arch based distros.

### Deploy .sh

Script to deploy repository on github.

### DisableTracker .sh

GNOME's tracker is a CPU and privacy hog. This script disables the tracker

### Dotfiles .sh
